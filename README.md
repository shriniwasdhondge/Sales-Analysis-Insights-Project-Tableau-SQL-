# Sales-Analysis-Insights-Project-Tableau-SQL-

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the company's sales performance using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization. The goal was to deliver actionable insights through dynamic dashboards that highlight key sales metrics.

Features:

Data Source: The dataset includes historical sales data with details such as location, product categories, revenue, and customer segments.
Data Processing: SQL queries were used to clean, structure, and transform the data for analysis. Key operations included data normalization, handling missing values, and calculating total revenue and sales quantities.
Dashboard Creation: Using Tableau, interactive dashboards were created to showcase insights:
Total Revenue and Sales Quantity Overview: A high-level summary of revenue and sales quantities across different cities.
Top Locations: Visualization of the top-performing cities based on revenue and sales quantity.
Trend Analysis: A line chart showing monthly sales performance over the years.
Top 5 Products and Customers: Identification of the top-selling products and most valuable customers based on revenue generated.
Key Insights:

Mumbai and Bhopal emerged as the top revenue-generating cities.
The product with the highest sales was "Prod018," generating 6.00M in revenue.
The top customer segment, "Electricians," contributed 47.40M to the total revenue.
This project demonstrates the power of combining SQL for data processing and Tableau for data visualization to gain insights into sales trends and customer behaviors.
